					<p>The Editor would have been inclined to think that in relating this incident <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Quatermain was making himself interesting at the expense of the exact truth, did it not happen that a similar incident has come within his knowledge.—<cite>⁠Editor</cite>. <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>For the satisfaction of any who may be so disbelieving as to take this view of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Quatermain’s story, the Editor may state that a gentleman with whom he is acquainted, and whose veracity he believes to be beyond doubt, not long ago described to him how he chanced to kill <i>four</i> African elephants with four consecutive bullets. Two of these elephants were charging him simultaneously, and out of the four three were killed with the head shot, a very uncommon thing in the case of the African elephant.—<cite>⁠Editor</cite>. <a href="chapter-4.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
