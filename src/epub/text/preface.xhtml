<p>
It may be well to state that the incident of the “Thing that bites”
recorded in this tale is not an effort of the imagination. On the contrary, it
is “plagiarized.” Mandara, a well-known chief on the east coast of
Africa, has such an article, <i>and uses it</i>. In the same way the wicked
conduct attributed to Wambe is not without a precedent. T’Chaka, the Zulu
Napoleon, never allowed a child of his to live. Indeed he went further, for on
discovering that his mother, Unandi, was bringing up one of his sons in secret,
like Nero he killed her, and with his own hand.
